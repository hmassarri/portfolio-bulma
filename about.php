            <p class="mb-5">I'm a passionate user-centered designer and knowledge seeker at the heart. I thrive finding simple and creative solutions to complex problems. My ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies has been extremely beneficial as a product designer.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">My interests have always lied at the intersection of humanity and technology. While pursuing an engineering degree, I found myself gravitating towards computer science and finally design. I taught myself the principles of visual and web design while I was trying to build my own website, eventually leading to a career in web design.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">I believed that I am where I am now because of the convergence of multiple different paths. My diverse background combined with design expertise is what sets me apart as a designer.</p>
